 	<dt><strong> Purpose</strong> </dt>
	<dd> The purpose of UW Madison’s Southeast Dance Organization is to promote Southeast Asian culture within our community through dance. We seek to unify these cultures by educating ourselves about the different cultures, styles, exploring our own personal connection and identities. In pursuit of this, we aim to be a consistent and strong platform for dancers to develop confidence, self-awareness, friendships, and leadership skills.</dd>
